# HandTrackingProject
This is a Hand tracking Project which showcases the difference between **detection** and **tracking**.
Image Processing is the fundamental key to process your images before you apply any **mlops**.
This project has really has helped me understand the use of **opencv-python** and **mediapipe**.
I really hope this code helps for any beginner.<br>
The **HandTrackingMin** file is the minimum code required to get yourself a hand tracking application running.<br>
The **HandTrackingModule** uses the class concept and thus helps you create a module out of it.<br>
The **MyNewHandTracking** is probably a game/app which directly utilizes the Hand Tracking Module
